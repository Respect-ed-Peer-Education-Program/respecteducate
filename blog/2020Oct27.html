      The first time I went into a classroom of high school freshman to teach about sexual harassment and assault was a week after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape: the video that captured then-presidential candidate Donald Trump bragging about harassing and assaulting women. The 14-year-olds I taught that day weren’t uninformed: they had seen the news just like me, and just like me, they had their own opinions and concerns. As I talked to them about consent, reporting, and the law, I felt as though I was ignoring the elephant in the room. At the end of the presentation, I was bombarded with questions, including: 
      <br><br>
      “How can Trump be allowed/be a candidate to run this country after many sexual assault claims filed against him and his clear promotion of rape culture?”
      <br><br>
      “Should there be a trial against Donald Trump given the fact several women have come out saying that he sexually assaulted them?”
      <br><br>
      “Will you give this presentation to Trump[?]”
      <br><br>
      I did not have adequate answers to those questions four years ago, and I still don’t really have answers to them now.
      <br><br>
      As a director at Respect(Ed), I design curriculum around consent and sexual violence prevention for high school students. But it’s difficult to impress upon young people the importance of consent when all they have to do is read the news to see how easily men in power—right up to the man occupying the highest office in the land—get away with sexual violence. Is it really such a big deal, after all, if the president has done it?
      <br><br>
      Almost exactly one year after that presentation, the New York Times published the accusations against major film producer Harvey Weinstein, and the #MeToo movement exploded outward from there. From Access Hollywood, to Weinstein, to Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony at the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanugh, it is clear that the reality of sexual violence—long left unspoken—has come to the forefront of American poitical and cultural discourse. Sexual violence played a key role in the last presidential election and this one is no different, except that now both major party’s candidates face credible accusations. As a consent educator, I have not only had to grapple with how to discuss this situation directly with students, but I also find myself wondering how it will affect young people on a larger scale. What does it say about our country that, whoever we choose to be our next president this November, we do so knowing that he has likely committed acts of sexual violence?
      <br><br>
      The #MeToo movement has certainly encouraged reporting and formal action, but it has also changed the way we as individuals respond when we hear accusations. The justice system may still be seriously lacking when it comes to sexual violence, but after watching the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, hearing about the experiences of the young gymnasts on Team U.S.A. assaulted by Larry Nassar, and seeing thousands of survivors share their stories on social media, public opinion has begun to shift. Even when the legal system fails, we, as a society, are now far more likely to condemn sexual violence and make perpetrators face consequences for their actions. After all, rapists who don’t go to jail can still lose their jobs, their friends, their scholarships, their power and good standing in the community.
      <br><br>
      As an educator, I stress the importance of this kind of social accountability. But apathy runs deep. In my high school, as in many, sexual violence was common. By twelfth grade I could count on my hands the number of my classmates who I knew had raped a fellow student and gotten away with it. In spring of my senior year, I spent my free time scheduling sexual violence prevention presentations and filing the necessary paperwork to turn Respect(Ed) into a 501(c)3 nonprofit, and then I would go to AP Chemistry, where I sat two seats away from a rapist.
      <br><br>
      Social accountability needs to be modeled. If it is not, it is difficult to expect young people to take it seriously, internalize, and value it. When we dismiss accusations against high-profile figures—famous actors, media moguls, presidential candidates—it sets a precedent. Young people know about these accusations against people they are supposed to look up to, just as they know about the similar actions perpetrated by their very own peers. If Donald Trump never faced an investigation into the dozens of accusations of sexual harassment and assault against him, how could I expect the rapists at my school to face any consequences? I feel hypocritical calling on students to take this accountability seriously when the nation does not and when, at times, I haven’t either. It is clear to me that one of the biggest things we as a society do to normalize sexual violence is to do nothing about allegations against the famous and powerful. 
      <br><br>
      I alone cannot adequately condemn any perpetrator, just as I alone could not investigate the concerns brought to light by the Access Hollywood tapes. As a culture, we need to start holding perpetrators accountable. Merely acknowledging sexual violence is not enough. We cannot ask youth to take action that we are not prepared to take ourselves. Many of those first students I taught are voting-age now. Those students knew about the Access Hollywood tapes and they knew about Kavanaugh and now they know about Joe Biden. And this year’s ballot affords them no option to ensure that the man they vote for is held accountable for his past or future acts of sexual violence. Though it is clear now that formal action or investigation will only come from public pressure, I’m not dismissing due process. I’m not saying Biden or Trump are inherently guilty of crimes of sexual violence; they deserve proper investigations not just to prove their guilt, but even potentially to prove their innocence.
