      <p class="sectionText fullDateText">Jul. 17 2020</p>
      <p class="sectionText fullDateText">Jade Pfaefflin Bounds, Outreach & Education Director</p>
      <p class="sectionText">
	      Last Friday, Respect(Ed) released a video in which I, Jade, interview my former teammates on their perception of transgender athletes. The video is made up of 12 video call interviews that look at how my teammates' perception of me and my ability changed throughout my transition and how it informed their perception of trans athletes.

      <p class="sectionText">
	      <br><br>
	      In the video, I mostly let my teammates’ answers speak for themselves, but I would like to take the opportunity now to expound a bit on some of their responses.
	      <br><br>
	      Firstly, I did not ever race at youth nationals; however as Jaelen mentions, I was on the Northwest Regional Team, and I raced the other regional teams at the 2017 World Championships representing Northwest Youth Rowing. 
	      <br><br>
	      In response to the question about how the coaches evaluated my performance, Mars answers: 
	      <br><br>
	      
      </p>
	<p class="sectionText indentedSectionText">
	      “I remember there was a piece that we did where the women’s team was doing three of something and the men’s team was just doing like one or two more. You ended up finishing a whole piece after some of the other guys, but Ben was just like, ‘If you’re on the men’s team, you’re doing the men’s workouts.’ I feel like he was measuring you not necessarily on exactly what splits you could pull, but on your resolve.” 
	      <br><br>
	      
         </p> 
	    <p class="sectionText">
		    That day was incredibly influential for me. The workout was a mix of erg and running. The men’s workout consisted of multiple three-quarter mile runs in between erg pieces of the following distances: 6k, 5k, 4k, 3k, 2k, 1k, and 500m. The women’s workout was the same—minus the initial 6k. I had switched teams about two weeks before that day, and I wasn’t on testosterone yet. I completed the men’s workout eight minutes after practice ended. No one told me I had to finish. When I came inside to do the final erg piece, the assistant coach said, “You’re welcome to leave now,” as the practice had officially ended.I looked at Ben, my coach, and he just said, “If you want to finish it you can.” 
	            <br><br>
		    Ben’s evaluation of all of us was largely of our character and ‘resolve.’ In that sense, he cared more that we worked hard and tried our best than about what numbers we pulled. Workouts like that were what shaped me as an athlete;I had to try my hardest just to finish, so I learned to love hard work.
