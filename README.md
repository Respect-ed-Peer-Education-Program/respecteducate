## About Respect(Ed)
Respect(Ed) is a nonprofit organization run by and for young people, working to provide students with the tools they need to set the standards for their own health education. We believe that early and accurate education around sexuality and consent allows youth to lead healthier, safer lives. With our support, students can successfully advocate for and help realize the education they deserve.

*Respect(Ed) Peer Education Program is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit under EIN 83-4269894.*
