			<h2 class="sectionTitle">Respect(Ed) Peer Education Program Privacy Policy</h2>
	
			<p class="sectionText">
			Respect(Ed) Peer Education Program (“Respect(Ed)”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections 
			for its users. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, 
			use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website.  	
			<br><br>
			For purposes of this Agreement, “website” refers to the Respect(Ed) website, which can be accessed at 
			<a href="https://www.respectedpeereducation.org">https://www.respectedpeereducation.org</a>. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” 
			refer to Respect(Ed). “You” refers to you, as a user of the Respect(Ed) website. 
			<br><br>
			By accessing our website, you accept our Privacy Policy, and you consent to our collection, storage, use 
			and disclosure of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
			</p>

			<h2 class="sectionTitle">I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

			<p class="sectionText">
			Respect(Ed) collects personally identifiable information from users when they voluntarily provide such information, 
			for example, when a user signs up to join our mailing list; when a user signs up for a program or event; when a 
			user contacts us via our Contact Us page; or when a user donates money via the website. The kind of information 
			that Respect(Ed) collects may include name, email address, phone number, address and other information you choose to provide.
			</p>

			<h2 class="sectionTitle">II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</h2>

			<p class="sectionText">
			Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes 
			your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. Respect(Ed) does use third party service providers 
			including GitHub, MailChimp, and ActBlue, to help operate our website and administer activities on its behalf, such as 
			sending emails to users and collecting donations online. These third party vendors may have access to Users’ personal 
			information, which becomes subject to their individual privacy policies.  
			<br><br>
			In general, the Personal Information you provide
			to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use
			Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, add
			users to our mailing list, and send users requested digital resources

			from Respect(Ed) at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” and the bottom of
			any Respect(Ed) email or by contacting us directly at <a
			href="mailto:board@respectedpeereducation.org">board@respectedpeereducation.org</a>.

			the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or to respond to a court order, 
			subpoena, or search warrant. Respect(Ed) will also share personally identifiable information if it believes it is necessary 
			to protect the rights, property, and safety of Respect(Ed) or others.
			</p>

			<h2 class="sectionTitle">III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION</h2>

			<p class="sectionText">
			We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We further protect your 
			information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption 
			and firewalls. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or 
			destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our website, you acknowledge that you 
			understand and agree to assume these risks.
			</p>

			<h2 class="sectionTitle">IV. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h2>

			<p class="sectionText">
			Respect(Ed) may provide links from this website to other websites. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
			employed by those websites or the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected 
			by us through the Respect(Ed) website. Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third party website accessed 
			by selecting a link on our website. To the extent that you access or use our website through or on another website or application, 
			then the privacy policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application.

			agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and become aware of any modifications since your 
			last visit. By using our website, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please
